# About Me

I’m Courtney Vincent, a Master’s student in Business Analytics at Boston University, graduating in August 2025. I use data to uncover insights and support better decision-making across industries like healthcare, transportation, and e-commerce. My strengths include predictive modeling, customer analytics, SQL querying, and data storytelling.

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities in analytics, consulting, or marketing strategy starting in Fall 2025.
